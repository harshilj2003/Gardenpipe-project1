# Garden Pipe CFD Project (OpenFOAM – FreeCAD CFDOF)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the CFD analysis of a garden pipe with multiple holes.
The objective is to understand how volume discharge and pressure distribution
change with different hole configurations along the pipe.

## Current Work
- The geometry and CFD setup were created using FreeCAD.
- The mesh has been generated and written using the CFDOF plugin.
- The mesh case files are located in this directory.

## Numerical Approach
- The CSSE (Control Surface Sensitivity Equation) approach is used for
  analyzing flow behavior in the garden pipe.
- This approach helps in studying discharge characteristics across
  different control surfaces.

## Future Work
- Velocity field calculations will be performed.
- Pressure distribution calculations will be carried out.
- Comparison will be made for different hole positions along the pipe.

## Purpose
The garden pipe project helps in understanding how volume discharge and
pressure discharge vary in pipes with multiple outlets.

## Software Used
- FreeCAD (CFDOF Plugin)
- OpenFOAM
- ParaView

## Academic Note
This project is created for academic evaluation.
